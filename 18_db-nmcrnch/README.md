0. In seating arrangement 2.0, form new duo with your elbow buddy.

1. As a duo, review last work. Clean/tune/re-factor as necessary.

2. Replicate last work directory.

3. As a duo, write a Python script named stu_mean.py that will access the database built in your last assignment to

Look up each student’s grades
Compute each student’s average
Display each student’s name, id, and average
Create a table of IDs and associated averages, named "stu_avg"
Facilitate adding rows to the courses table

Guidelines+Protips:

Simplicity is divine.
Confer with your partner, use some KtS, and reach a consensus about implementation before coding. Aim for clarity, simplicity, robustness, maintainability.
Note anything notable. (in your notebook and in-line comments in your code).
Use QAF liberally.
Use the sqlite shell to test out SQL commands before baking them into your Python script.
To test the last 2 features, you should add rows to the end of courses.csv to reflect a new term's worth of course enrollment for your students.
It may be helpful during development to delete your db file between runs.
File this under 18_db-nmcrnch in your workshop. (Both Devos.)
